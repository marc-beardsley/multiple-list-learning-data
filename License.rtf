\f1\b0\fs28 \cf2 The Open Data Commons Attribution License is a license agreement\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 intended to allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 subject only to the attribution requirements set out in Section 4.\
Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 and so this license only governs the rights over the Database, and not\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 the contents of the Database individually. Licensors may therefore wish\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 to use this license together with another license for the contents.\
Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 trademark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 activities not covered by this License.\

\f0\b\fs48 \cf2 2.0 What this License covers\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl320\sa200\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs28 \cf2 2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:\
a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;\
b. A license of the Database Right; and\
c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.\
2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Database, including:\
a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Contents stored in the Database;\
b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 not infringe any applicable copyright; and\
c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 use on this access as outlined in this License.\
2.3 Rights not covered.\
a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 or operation of the Database;\

The individual items of\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 the rights over the images.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl600\sa140\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs48 \cf2 3.0 Rights granted\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl320\sa200\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs28 \cf2 3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 future.\
The rights granted cover, for example:\
a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 the Contents;\
b. Creation of Derivative Databases;\
c. Creation of Collective Databases;\
d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and\
e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Databases.\
3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:\
a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 of the rights granted under this License;\
b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 the rights granted under this License; and,\
c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 granted under this License.\
3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.\

\f0\b\fs48 \cf2 4.0 Conditions of Use\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl320\sa200\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs28 \cf2 4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 in material breach of its terms.\
4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 must:\
a. Do so only under the terms of this License;\
b. Include a copy of this License or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation;\
c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 that refer to this License; and\
d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 look for it.\
4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 is available under this License.\
a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Section 4.3:\

    under the ODC Attribution License.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl320\sa200\partightenfactor0

\f1\fs28 \cf2 \cb3 DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 hyperlink to the location of the Database. \'93ODC Attribution License\'94\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 should contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 required URI\'92s with the above notice.\
4.4 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 You communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Contents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 terms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 under this License.\

\f0\b\fs48 \cf2 5.0 Moral rights\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl320\sa200\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs28 \cf2 5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 to be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 that would otherwise prejudice the author\'92s honour and reputation, or\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 any other derogatory treatment:\
a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 10.4;\
b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Section 10.4; and\
c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.\
Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 jurisdictions.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl600\sa140\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs48 \cf2 6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl320\sa200\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs28 \cf2 6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Database, including without limitation:\

The repeated and systematic Extraction or\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Contents.\

\f0\b\fs48 \cf2 9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License\

\f1\b0\fs28 \cf2 9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 notice to You.
